# ATM System

## Object Oriented Programming - Fall 2019 Group Final Project

This ATM system requires a user to input an account number and pin to access their personal bank account. Once logged in, the user can either deposit, withdraw, and balance checking. Our system displays and prints user recipets after transaction is complete.
