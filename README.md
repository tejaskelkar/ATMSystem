# ATM System

## Object Oriented Programming - Fall 2019 Group Final Project

This ATM system requires a user to input an account number and pin to access their personal bank account. Once logged in, the user can either deposit, withdraw, and balance checking. Our system displays and prints user recipets after transaction is complete. 

Users also have an option to create a new account if it is their first time using the ATM machine. 

To run the program, make sure the file being imported in atm.java has the correct filepath to an atm text file. We have provided a sample ATM text file that you can use. Once the program is run, the console will output instructions on how to naviagte the ATM.
